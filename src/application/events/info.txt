Event Handling:

It contains code related to the handling of events that occur within your application.
Events can represent important state changes, actions, or occurrences, and the "events" folder is where you define how your application responds to these events.
Event Dispatching:

It includes logic for dispatching events when certain conditions are met or actions are performed in your application.
Dispatching events allows different parts of your application to respond to those events asynchronously.
